### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "feature" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

We could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

## Setup

To set up the development environment, follow the instructions in the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure your changes pass all the tests. If your changes are not covered by existing tests, please add new test cases.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request from your forked repo, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for the latest stable version. Other supported versions are welcome, but it must work on the stable version.
4. Each pull request should be small and tackle a single feature or bug fix. This makes it easier to review and merge.
5. Larger changes should be discussed via an issue before submission.

## Building the Documentation

Add any new features or update any existing documentation in the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow the project's code of conduct in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file. Please review the code of conduct before contributing.
